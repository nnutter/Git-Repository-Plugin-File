Revision history for Git::Repository::Plugin::File:

0.006 2014-01-01
 - Updated docs.
 - remove() now returns the file object instead of 1.
 - remove() now throws an exception if the file is not removed.  This strays
   from the Path::Class::File behavior but is more consistent with the
   Git::Repository behavior.
 - add(), commit(), and remote() separate options and the file path with double dashes.

0.005 2013-12-30
 - "Backport" the opena method.

0.004 2013-12-30
 - Add missing dependency on Test::Fatal.

0.003 2013-12-30
 - Specify versions on several dependencies.

0.002 2013-12-28
 - Extend Path::Class::File instead of just delegating methods to it.

0.001 2013-12-27
 - Initial release.
